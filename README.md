Smart Treasure Hunt
===================

INTRODUCTION
------------

Smart Treasure Hunt is a pervasive game designed and developed for the Pervasive Systems course at Università degli Studi di Roma "La Sapienza".
This project allowed us to address common issues about the limits of current techniques for what concern indoor localization and deal 
with technologies that typically belongs to the "Pervasive World" (e.g, proximity algorithms, wireless sensor networks, web services, Bluetooth and so on).

The goal of the game is to let players find an hidden device treasure by using their own smartphones/tablets. The application provides suggestions
based on devices sensors (i.e., suggestions about the environmental conditions percept by the treasure device) and GPS/Bluetooth technologies 
(i.e, suggestions about the distance among players and treasure).


TECHONOLOGIES
-------------

The main technologies used for this project are:

* Android
* Global Positioning System (GPS): Used for outdoor distance measurement
* Assisted-GPS (A-GPS): Used for outdoor/indoor distance measurement 
* Bluetooth: Used for nearby distance measurement
* Wi-Fi: For network connection and accuracy improvement in distance measurement
* Sensors: Environmental conditions perception
	* Photoresistor
	* Thermometer
	* Microphone
	* Accelerometer
	* Gyroscope
* RESTful Web Server: Used for storing players and treasure metadata


ARCHITECTURE
------------

The system architecture is composed by:
* Web Server: Keeps informations about players and treasure (ID, Name, sensors data, coordinates)
* Treasure Device: After the registration on the Web Server, periodically updates its own data on the web server in order to make available this informations 
			 to the players.
			 Moreover, continuously sends advertising packets via Bluetooth in order to be sensed by nearby hunter devices.
* Hunter Device:	After the registration on the Web Server, periodically retrieves treasure data from the web server in order to know the environmental 
			conditions around the treasure device and its coordinates. 
			Continuously performs Bluetooth discovery task in order to find the treasure device and computes the distance based on RSSI.

* StartupActivity: Displays authors and course informations
* MainActivity:	Let the players choose the role of the device (Treasure, Hunter)
* TreasureActivity: Embed the treasure task described above
* HunterActivity:	Embed the hunter task described above
* EndingActivity: Notifies to the players (via Web Server) that the game is ended.

Each device, independently from their role, reads its own sensors.
If the device is the treasure, it posts this data on the web server.
Otherwise, if the device is the hunter, it retrieves treasure data from the web server and compares them to its 
own in order to recognize significant changes in the environmental conditions.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

* Download and install java (1.8.0+).
* Download and install Android Studio (latest version).
* Download NetBeans with Tomcat web server and install them (latest version).
* Import the project SmartTreasureHunt on Android Studio.
* Import the project WSPervasiveSTH on NetBeans.
* Build and deploy the WSPervasiveSTH web server.
* Install the SmartTreasureHunt app on your android device.
* Run the SmartTreasureHunt app from your android device.
* Enjoy the hunt!

CURRENT STATUS
--------------
Committed tasks:
* Main functionalities - the game is playable
* Web server/Web service
* GPS/A-GPS and Bluetooth connections
* Sensors data read:photoresistor, thermometer, accelerometer, gyroscope. (Not available to the players yet)

In progress tasks:
* Provide microphone sensor data
* Make sensors data available to the players
* Increase indoor accuracy (statistical approach, ad hoc algorithms).
* Increase application robustness
* User friendly interface
* Testing phase
